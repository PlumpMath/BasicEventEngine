BasicEventEngine is an event-driven game engine which the user can interface with via the Sprite, 
Sound, Background, Font, Path, Object, and Room classes. The Room class is used to organize the 
resources for each section of the game and the Object class is used to act upon the events from the 
main loop. A small example is included with all non-engine code in the resources directory.

The available events are the virtual functions of the Object class which are on lines 59 to 80 in 
the file bee/resource_structures/object.hpp

The software is in early alpha so do not expect any sort of stability. If you have any questions or 
comments, feel free to email me. Also feel free to contribute to the engine code, either by email 
or via github.
